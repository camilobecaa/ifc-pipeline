### Selecting which version of BIMSurfer to use

Usage of v1 is not recommended in new projects, because of the dependency on outdated libraries and lack of a stable API. Choose v3 for highest performance, but note that is webgl2 only, which is not universally supported (54% at the time of writing [source](https://webglstats.com/webgl2)). v2 can be used solely on static files generated by IfcOpenShell and is entirely built around open standards such as glTF. v3 has an interesting set of additional features such as partial support for 3D Tiles, measurements and up to 6 section planes.
